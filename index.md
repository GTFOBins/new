{{ page.description }}

The project [collects]({{ '/scope/' | relative_url }}) legitimate functions of Unix-like executables that can be abused to ~~get the f**k~~ break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate other post-exploitation tasks.

GTFOBins is a joint effort by [Emilio Pinna][norbemi] and [Andrea Cardaci][cyrus_and], and many other [contributors][]. Everyone can [get involved]({{ '/contributing/' | relative_url }}) by providing additional entries and techniques!

If you are looking for Windows binaries you should visit [LOLBAS][].

> Please note that this is **not** a list of exploits, and the programs listed here are not vulnerable per se, rather, GTFOBins is a compendium about how to live off the land when you only have certain executables available.
