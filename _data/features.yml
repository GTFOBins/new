sudo:
  label: Sudo
  description: If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by `sudo`, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.

suid:
  label: SUID
  description: If the binary has the SUID bit set, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be abused to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access as a SUID backdoor.
  extra:
    limited: It is used to run commands (e.g., via `system()`-like invocations) so it only works on systems like Debian (<= Stretch) that allow the default `sh` shell to run with SUID privileges.
    regular: If it is used to run `sh -p`, omit the `-p` argument on systems like Debian (<= Stretch) that allow the default `sh` shell to run with SUID privileges.

capabilities:
  label: Capabilities
  description: If the binary has certain capabilities set then this function is invoked with elevated privileges.
