unprivileged:
  label: Unprivileged
  description: This function can be performed by any unprivileged user.

sudo:
  label: Sudo
  description: This function is performed by the superuser if executed via `sudo` because the acquired privileges are not dropped.

suid:
  label: SUID
  description: This function is performed by the superuser if the binary has the SUID bit set and the right ownership because the *effective* privileges are not dropped.
  extra:
    limited: The binary runs external commands via functions like `system`, so it only works for distributions like Debian (<= Stretch) where the default shell does not drop SUID privileged.
    regular: If present, remember to omit the `-p` argument of every `sh` invocation on distributions like Debian (<= Stretch) where the default shell does not drop SUID privileged.

capabilities:
  label: Capabilities
  description: This function is performed bypassing the usual kernel permission checks if the binary has certain capabilities set.
