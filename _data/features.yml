sudo:
  label: Sudo
  description: If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by `sudo`, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.

suid:
  label: SUID
  description: |
    If the binary has the SUID bit set, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be abused to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access as a SUID backdoor. If it is used to run `sh -p`, omit the `-p` argument on systems like Debian (<= Stretch) that allow the default `sh` shell to run with SUID privileges.

limited-suid:
  label: Limited SUID
  description: |
    If the binary has the SUID bit set, it may be abused to access the file system, escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID backdoor. If it is used to run commands (e.g., via `system()`-like invocations) it only works on systems like Debian (<= Stretch) that allow the default `sh` shell to run with SUID privileges.

capabilities:
  label: Capabilities
  description: If the binary has the Linux `CAP_SETUID` capability set or it is executed by another binary with the capability set, it can be used as a backdoor to maintain privileged access by manipulating its own process UID.
